					<h2>Dentel Care</h2>
						<h4>The Nations Dental Clinic is located on the 1st floor of Nations Hospital. The clinic, being part of the hospital, is JCI accredited and follows strict international and national safety standards to deliver comprehensive care. The clinic offers advanced oral-maxillofacial surgical care drawing on the strength of the hospital’s multi-speciality centres and expertise.
Taking care of your oral health is an investment in your overall health – the health of your mouth, teeth and gums can affect your general health, and can also be a window to your overall health. Poor oral health can contribute to cardiovascular disease, pregnancy complications and pneumonia and conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and osteoporosis can worsen oral health.
